# TITLE: Temperature, Humidity, Air Quality Monitoring System Using ESP8266, DHT11 Sensor, MQ135 Sensor and Blynk App
Student: NURASHIDA BINTI MOHD. DESA

# Objective:   
This project aims to build a temperature, humidity, and air quality monitoring system using an ESP8266 microcontroller and a DHT11 and MQ135 sensor to send data to the Blynk app over Wi-Fi. Through the Blynk App, this system provides real-time data monitoring and management presenting a user-friendly interface. In addition, it can set up alert notifications in the Blynk App and retain the latest temperature, humidity and air quality data in EEPROM, ensuring that the data is maintained even after a system restart.
